**If I Didn’t Have You (Bernadette’s Song)**

	If I didn’t have you
	Life would be blue
	I’d be Dr. Who without the Tardis
	A candle without a wick
	A Watson without a Crick
	I’d be one of my outfits without a Dick-ie
	I’d be cheese without the mac
	Jobs without the Wozniak
	I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not
	found on your calculator making it much harder to crack
	I’d be an atom without a bomb
	A dot without the com
	And I’d probably still live with my mom 

	And he’d probably still live with his mom 

	Ever since I met you
	You turned my world around
	You supported all my dreams and all my hopes
	You’re like Uranium 235 and I’m Uranium 238
	Almost inseparable isotopes 



	I couldn’t have imagined
	How good my life would get
	From the moment that I met you, Bernadette 



	If I didn’t have you
	Life would be dreary
	I’d be string theory without any string
	I’d be binary code without a one
	A cathode-ray tube without an electron gun
	I’d be “Firefly,” “Buffy” and “Avengers” without Joss Whedon
	I’d speak a lot more Klingon Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam 

	And he’d definitely still live with his mom 

	Ever since I met you
	You turned my world around
	You’re my best friend and my lover
	We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields
	You can’t have one without the other 



	I couldn’t have imagined
	How good my life would get
	From the moment that I met you, Bernadette 



	Oh, we couldn’t have imagined
	How good our lives would get
	From the moment that we met you, Bernadette
